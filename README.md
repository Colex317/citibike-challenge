As the new lead analyst for the New York Citi Bike program, you are now responsible for overseeing the largest bike-sharing program in the United States. In your new role, you will be expected to generate regular reports for city officials looking to publicize and improve the city program. Since 2013, the Citi Bike program has implemented a robust infrastructure for collecting data on the program's utilization. Each month, bike data is collected, organized, and made public on the [Citi Bike Website](https://citibikenyc.com/system-data)

However, while the data has been regularly updated, the team has yet to implement a dashboard or sophisticated reporting process.

# Questions
In this assignment, the aim was to aggregate the data found in the Citi Bike Trip History Logs and find two unexpected phenomena. The phenomena that I have chosen are:
1. Most popular start and end stations:
    - What are the top 10 stations in the city for starting a journey (for the months of January and June)? Based on the data, why?
    - What are the top 10 stations in the city for ending a journey (for the months of January and June)? Based on the data, why?

2. Citibike usage and trip durations:
   - What is the duration of a bike trip for the top 10 users?
   - How many trips have been recorded in total during the chosen period?
   - What is the average trip duration per user type (customer vs. subscribers)?
   - What is the average trip duration for the months of January and June?

3. Gender analysis:
     - What is the average trip for each gender by user type?
     - What is the typical start time by gender?
